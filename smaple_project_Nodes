Today Topic:
===================Project Sessions ===========
Project ===> Source code development application  + Testing + Deployment of Production Servers


========== Sample Project Without container / Cluster ========

                     Pipeline Project / Declarative / Script 
Jenkins setup:
 Problem : Application code is available in GitHub Repo .... we need seclude a pipeline job for every day at 1 pm job will trigger automatically when the cnages may happed ... using the Jenkins file and tools as maven , sq, ne, tomcat.. go pom.xml

Step1 : Open the pom.xml for application understating and open the source code  

     pom.xml ==> 

Step 2: Create a Jenkins file

Code is available at GitHub we need to get the code into Jenkins server

we need to create a communication channel in between Jenkins & GitHub
        GitHub ==username with password
        Jenkins server credentials pages add update 

         Manage Jenkins === credentials page

            then go to pipeline syntax == git ==> GitHub repo URL == branch == credential 

Steps 3 : Code validate 
              Manage Jenkins ===> configuration === maven install

Step 4: Code Scan
              we will interact with Dev team we need the information for rules condition
                  Sonar Qube server apply email notification send 
                     we need to create a communication channel in between Jenkins & SQ
                          Plugin == SonarQube Scanner 
                             Sonar Token update == credentials
                                   pom.xml == under properties tab  == sq server details

Step 5: Code backup:
         we need to create a communication channel in between Jenkins & Nexus
             Plugin == ConfigFile provider 
                 nexus user name password
                      maven== settings.xml ==> Server details === repo name / user name / password
                           Jenkins server == under == tools section == under maven == conf == 
                       pom.xml == distribution management tab ==
                          adding the repos in general repo & snapshot repo === based on version 
                               back up will placed 
Step 6: Code deployment in Production server:
        we need to create a communication channel in between Jenkins & Tomcat
            Plugin : Container to deploy 
                       Jenkins server === configure == tomcat url
                            tomcat creational add
Step 7: Email Notification:
              Plugin email:
                 SNS Notification ;;;; Job Success / failed / reject/ all users 



Jenkins File :  

 pipeline {
    agent any

    tools 
      maven = maven3

    stages {
        stage("Getting the source code"){
            steps{
                git clone url
            }
        }

        stage ("code validate"){
            steps{
                sh "mvn clean validate"
            }
        }

        stage ("code scan"){
            steps{
                sh "sonar:sonar"
            }
        }

        stage ("code backup"){
            steps{
                configFileProvider
            }
        }

        stage ("deployment of code"){
            steps{
                sh "scp -o "
            }
        }

        stage ("emal notifiacation"){
            steps{
                Email send 
            }
        }
    }
}
